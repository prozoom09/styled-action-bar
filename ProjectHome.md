An example Android application which demonstrates how to style the Honeycomb [Action Bar](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ActionBar.html) component.  This application demonstrates how to use Styles and Drawables to customise the look and feel of the Action Bar.

In addition, it exercises much of the functionality offered by the Action Bar including:
  * Icon / Logo / Home as up styles
  * Standard / List / Tab navigation
  * Action Item text / icon combinations
  * Action View example
  * Action Bar background
